## A library without end, for ideas found a long the garden of forking paths

> *"The Library of Babel" (original Spanish title: La biblioteca de Babel) is a short story by Argentine author and librarian Jorge Luis Borges (1899â€“1986), conceiving of a universe in the form of a vast library containing all possible 410-page books of a certain format and character set.*

## random project ideas

* **Trapped in Classics** *ar/vr or other 4d media* - a view from 'inside' classic paintings and works that provides an inverted view, viewer can look around, see the painting even moving

* **The Kelsey Algorithmic Archaeology Department** *embedded machine learning practice* -- based on the Ryoichi excavations, a fan-fiction to archaeology where pictures of the Kelsey archaeology archives are processed through a Machine Learning model and then given fantastical background stories before being handcrafted then passed off as "visiting exhibits" within the Kelsey

## plays

* **Faglandia** -- 7 queers and a token straight guy must grapple with a new queer deity who invades their Zoom play rehearsal
(in-progress)

* **Some more White shit** - A monologue play about a solo white performer surrounded by white text talking about whiteness.
